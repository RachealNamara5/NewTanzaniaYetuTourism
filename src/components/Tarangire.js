            Best Time to Visit Tarangire National Park
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The best time to visit Tarangire is during the dry season from June to October. During these months, wildlife congregates around the Tarangire River, making game viewing easier and more rewarding with increased animal densities and migratory patterns. To observe large herds of animals, particularly elephants, visit between July and October. For bird watchers, the wet season from November to May offers optimal conditions as it is outside peak season but still relatively dry. The low season from late November to May is ideal for bird watching, as the park becomes lush and green.

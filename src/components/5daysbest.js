          <p className="mt-2">
            After breakfast, your safari driver guide will pick you up from your hotel and you will set off for Tarangire National Park, a drive of about two and a half hours on well-maintained tarmac roads. Named after the Tarangire River, the park serves as the critical water source for wildlife during the dry season, earning its nickname "River of Warthogs". Tarangire National Park is renowned for the large elephant herds often seen near the river, as well as giraffes, bushbucks, and hartebeests, which attract predators like lions and leopards. Tarangire is also home to more bird breeding species than anywhere on Earth, and you will marvel at the ancient baobab trees, some over a thousand years old. Enjoy a picnic lunch within the park before continuing your journey to your accommodation in Karatu after the game drive.

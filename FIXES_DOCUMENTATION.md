# Tanzania Yetu Tourism - Authentication and Verification Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Account Verification Flow**: Users were being directed to the booking page immediately after signup without verifying their email address.

2. **Localhost Verification Links**: Email verification links were pointing to localhost instead of the production domain.

3. **Missing Email Verification Check**: The application was not properly checking if a user's email was verified before allowing access to the booking system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.js`)

- Added `isEmailVerified` helper function to check if a user's email is confirmed
- Modified `signIn` function to check email verification status before allowing login
- Added `isEmailVerified` to the context value for use in components

### 2. Updated Booking Component (`src/components/Booking.js`)

- Added `isEmailVerified` from AuthContext
- Modified the useEffect hook to only proceed to booking step if email is verified
- Updated `handleAuthSubmit` to check email verification status after login
- Added helpful messages to guide users through the verification process
- Added explanatory text for signup flow about email verification

### 3. Created Production Email Template (`email-templates/confirm-signup-production.html`)

- Created a new email template with a direct link to the production booking page
- Replaced the `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` placeholder with a direct link to `https://tanzania-yetu-travel.vercel.app/booking`

## Manual Steps Required

To fully fix the verification link issue, you need to update the Supabase project settings:

1. **Update Site URL in Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to Authentication → Settings
   - Update the "Site URL" to: `https://tanzania-yetu-travel.vercel.app`
   - Save the changes

2. **Update Email Template in Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to Authentication → Email Templates
   - Select "Confirm signup" template
   - Replace the content with the content from `email-templates/confirm-signup-production.html`
   - Save the changes

3. **Update Redirect URLs** (if needed):
   - In the same Authentication → Settings section
   - Add `https://tanzania-yetu-travel.vercel.app/*` to the "Redirect URLs" list
   - Save the changes

## How the Fix Works

1. **Signup Flow**:
   - User creates an account
   - User receives email with verification link
   - After clicking verification link, user is redirected to the booking page
   - User can now sign in successfully

2. **Login Flow**:
   - User attempts to sign in
   - System checks if email is verified
   - If not verified, user gets an error message and stays on login page
   - If verified, user proceeds to booking page

3. **Booking Access**:
   - Only users with verified emails can access the booking page
   - Unverified users are redirected back to the login page

## Testing the Fix

1. Create a new test account
2. Check that you receive an email with a verification link pointing to the production domain
3. Click the verification link
4. Try to sign in with the verified account
5. Confirm you can access the booking page
6. Try to sign in with an unverified account (should be blocked)

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains the existing user experience while adding proper verification checks
- Error messages guide users through the verification process
- The production email template provides a direct link to the booking page for better UX
